#load in the CSV file for employees

We are going to use this: 
    -Import-Csv -Path "C:\Employees.csv" -Delimiter "," 
Most people stop here so instead we continue our command line. To write name and Last name properly and we can change for example, "office" to "physicalDeliveryOfficeName" or 
"FirstName" to " GivenName 
instead of changing later we cahnge now amd it will help us later
