# Powershell

In this lab I will try to show some basic Powersell exercises.

First of all, we need to create a CSV file https://www.convertcsv.com/generate-test-data.htm

If you want to do this from Windows 10 or 11 client machine then you need to  download RSAT Tools from Microsoft website  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools

Note: Windows Client Machine should be connected to the domain.

You can put the list of employees file into notepad then save it to C: disk. 

Make sure that user is under your domain name ,not in a folder to find the user

You can also activate Advanced Features to see more options about user view > Advanced Features
