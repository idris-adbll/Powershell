# Powershell

In this lab I will try to show some basic Powersell exercises.

First of all, we need to create a CSV file .https://www.convertcsv.com/generate-test-data.htm

If you want to do this from Windows 10 or 11 client machine then you need to  download RSAT Tools from Microsoft website 
Note: Windows Client Machine should be connected to the domain.

You can put the list of employees file into notepad then save it to C: disk.
